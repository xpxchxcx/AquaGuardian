We utilised Arduino and developed Aqua Bot, a low-cost wireless floating contamination detector to detect the unlawful pollution by the companies in the seas. Our state-of-the-art Aqua Bot provides superior usability and performance in combating real-world water pollution scenarios.

The device can detect changes in the water quality and act as an early alert to notify authorities of any irregularities. This can help authorities take quicker action against unlawful polluters and reduce marine pollution over time. With the reduction in water pollution, our marine life and resources can be better protected.
With Aqua Bot, our dreams of clean waters with beautiful marine ecosystems can become a reality!

## Easy to Deploy
Aqua Bot can be easily deployed by boating out to pollution areas and anchoring it using fishing lines to prevent it from drifting too far.

## Self-Sustainable
Aqua Bot is powered by an on-board solar panel, which provides sufficient energy for it to conduct its operations 24/7.

## Circuit Diagram
Aqua Bot prototype comprises of:
- Microcontroller
- WiFi module
- Antenna for long distance communication
- pH Sensor
- Luthium Batteries
- Solar Power Manager
- Solar Panel

We built a website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript for users to use in tandam with our Aqua Bots. Real-time readings are retrieved from Firebase and displayed on the website for efficient monitoring.

## For Personal Use
The average user can report suspected water pollution sites via a Google Form on the website. Authorities with access to the form results can then take quicker action to deploy our Aqua Bots to monitor these water pollution sites.

## For Corporate Use
Companies can sign in to their registered emails and track water pollution with real-time updates from our Aqua Bots.
